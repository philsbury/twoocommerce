 # Cart item data (when outputting non-flat)
 #
 # This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/cart/cart-item-data.php.
 #
 # HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 # (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 # maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 # happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 # the readme will list any important changes.
 #
 # @see         https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
 # @package     WooCommerce\Templates
 # @version     2.4.0
